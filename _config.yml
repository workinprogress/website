  Work in Progress is a daily live show about product management - shipping, working with teams, making design decisions, debating what makes it into a product, knowing when to throw something away, etc. It's all current - stuff Nathan and I are struggling with on a daily basis. Sometimes we'll show work in progress and critique each other's work and ideas. Each show lasts about 30 minutes, so join in, subscribe to the channel, and hopefully learn a thing or two.
